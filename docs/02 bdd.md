In BDD the features/behaviours of a system are expressed through "stories" which are broken down into "scenarios". Each scenario describes a single application of a behaviour and relates to a single automated test.

The stories and scenarios are written in the terminology of the problem domain, allowing the business owners and developers to dicuss and reason about the behaviour of the system in a common ubiquitous language.

We use [SpecFlow](http://specflow.org) to execute the scenarios as automated tests.
