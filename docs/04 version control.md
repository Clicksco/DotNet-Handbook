All projects must be version controlled. At Clicksco we use [Git](http://git-scm.com).

## Workflow

The workflow used may vary project to project. The popular ones are:

* [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) which prescribes a very structured approach to working with git.
* [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) which is much simpler.

Choose the one right for your project.
